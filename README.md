# GenerativeChatbot
Experimenting with different LLM transformers from Hugging Face.  Simple console based chatbots are used to demonstrate.

currently, the hug_falcon.py and hug_face.py chatbots run, however they could use a lot of improvment.  Both need to be cleaned up (delete unused code and refactor).  After I make a little more progress, I will attempt to make fine-tuning as simple as specifying a documents folder and calling a method of the chatbot class.
